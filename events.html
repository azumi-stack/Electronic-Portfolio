      <h2>BUWAN NG WIKA</h2>
      <p>During the Buwan ng Wika, I was able to nurture my appreciation for Filipino culture and deepen my understanding of our national heroes, language, and history. The event reminded me how important it is to value and preserve our identity as Filipinos through our words and traditions. I participated in the “Tagisan ng Talino,” which gave me the chance to showcase what I know while learning from others.</p>

    <section class="event-section">
      <h2>INTRAMURALS</h2>
      <p>The Intramurals taught me that many students have a passionate and determined spirit for sports, showing that talent and dedication are not just in academics. Through the games, I learned the importance of teamwork, discipline, and respect, both in victory and defeat. I joined basketball, volleyball, and Mobile Legends, where I experienced the excitement of competition. This event made me realize that sports can also build character, strengthen friendships, and bring the school community together.</p>
